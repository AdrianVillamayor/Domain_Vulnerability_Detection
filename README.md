# Domain Vulnerability Detector

A script to quickly obtain the subdomains of any domain and generate a vulnerability log.

This script allows vulnerability testing to prevent attacks and loss of sensitive information.

<br>

# How it works

This project uses the [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) lists.

This script uses response from [crt.sh](https://crt.sh) to obtain the subdomains.

<br>

## Example usage
```
python3 init.py github.com
```
<br>

## What does the command do? 
Following the example with the Github domain (using another domain the files will be renamed to the domain name):

- Generates a __github.json__ file with all the subdomains of the Github.com domain.

- Start the __penetration test__ for each of the subdomains.

- Generates a __github.txt__ file with a complete log.

- Generate a __github_vulnerabilities.txt__ with all the vulnerabilities found.
